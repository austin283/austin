      <h1> GOJO's life story</h1>
      <p> Satoru Gojo was born on December 7, 1989.[1] He was the first person in approximately four hundred years to inherit both the Limitless inherited technique and the Six Eyes.[2] After he was born, the balance of power shifted and Satoru had a bounty worth over a hundred million put on his head and was targeted by bounty hunters, however they were ultimately powerless before him.</p>
      <p>During his second year as a student, Gojo along with his classmates, Suguru Geto and Shoko Ieiri, went to check up on Mei Mei and Utahime after not hearing from them in two days. After the three manage to rescue Mei Mei and Utahime along with dealing with the curse, Geto along with Gojo and Shoko attend a meeting where Masamichi Yaga punishes Gojo for not putting up a curtain.[5]</p>
