        <p>During one of the series' popularity polls, Akutami even went as far as advising the female audience to cast their votes for Nanami over Gojo. Such a recommendation from the creator himself speaks volumes
            about his feelings towards Gojo. Furthermore, Akutami has criticized Gojo for lacking depth, going on record to say that
            the character doesn't have a likable
            personality.
            One of the primary reasons behind Akutami's aversion towards Gojo seems to stem from the character's immense popularity among fans. Akutami believes that much of this adoration is based solely on Gojo's striking appearance, overshadowing his more abrasive
            personality traits. </p>
